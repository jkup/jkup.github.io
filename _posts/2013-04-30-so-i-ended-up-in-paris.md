title: So I Ended Up In Paris
description: Having been too busy to even think about the impending trip. Today at 9:30am, Kelly and I stepped out onto the wonderful, winding streets of Paris.

It feels like a dream. A dream that isn't mine.

## The Arrival

We landed at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport around 9:25am. Stepping off the plane felt like the end of any other trip. We stepped off and into the airport. It was interesting to see all the signs which stated their message first in French and then English underneath. 

Walking through the airport there were some minor differences noticed, but realistically they could have been written off as mere eccentricities airports use to distinguish themselves. The first real oddity came when we stepped onto the escalator heading down and the stairs flattened into something of an electronic ramp taking us down to the lower level. We all almost fell -- expecting the stairs to, well, stay stairs as we traveled downwards.

There were many of these stair-less escalators throughout the airport, one of them encased in a glass tube as it carried us up towards or baggage claim. As we were traveling upwards, we came into an enormous, open room with at least 4 other glass tubes. All presumably carrying passengers to where they needed to be. It felt like some science fiction movie watching all of these people floating through glass tubes in every direction. It was the first of many moments in which we realized we were in a new culture.

We found our luggage without a hitch and just as we exited the terminal, our driver was there waiting with a sign for us. I didn't know the Charles de Gaulle Airport was a good half hour away from Paris -- but smartly Kelly had arranged for a driver to pick us up and take us directly to our hotel.

Unfortunately, this driver did not speak English. It was a very quiet ride into the city.

## The Ride

I have to say, the ride from the airport into the city was underwhelming. With mostly factories and outlet malls, it felt very much like a highway trip one would take in Michigan.

After about 20 minutes in the car, we finally began to see some of the buildings that one would expect to see when traveling in Paris. They were off in the distance but they were old and breath taking. At one point we even saw the tip of the Eiffel tower looming off in the distance.

Eventually we pulled off the highway onto a busy Boulevard. ( As far as I can tell Boulevard means a big city street and Rue is a smaller road. ). We were driving through a beautiful, bustling city now. With endless stores and restaurants on the main floor. It was definitely a wonderful experience, but besides the abundance of French writing, it was akin to driving down a street in New York or Chicago.

Eventually our driver pulled over on a small road. He stopped the van and we all got out. There were many shops around and it was not clear where our hotel might be. Kelly communicated with him via gestures and hand signals and eventually he picked up her suitcase and took a turn down a tiny alley off of the main road.

This was the first breathtaking moment I had in Paris. I was expecting restaurant dumpsters or dark, grease-soaked streets like an alleyway you'd see in America. Instead, we saw this:

Paris is truly full of surprises. The busy boulevards are much like you'd see in other major cities. However there are countless winding alleyways with narrow one way roads lined with fancy restaurants, great hotels, and wonderful graffiti.

## The Hotel

We entered our hotel at around 10am, only to find that check-in wasn't until 2pm and they didn't seem very interested in accommodating us. We were, begrudgingly allowed, to keep our luggage in a public corner of the lobby. 

It's probably worth noting that this time that we left Chicago at 6pm, flew 8 hours in the plane and arrived in Paris at 9:30 am -- mostly without sleep. Needless to say we were quite exhausted.

We stuffed our belongings into the hotel lobby and headed out to the streets. Despite our complete exhaustion, it was still a wonderful experience wandering the streets of Paris early in the morning. Unfortunately, it was Sunday and almost everything in Paris is closed on Sundays. We just walked the streets taking in the many sights. There were a lot of great parks, interesting shops, public recycling stations, bicycle rentals and so many dogs!

Finally we found our way to a small bar / cafe for our first Parisian dining experience. Luckily, as not one of us spoke French, we had a very charismatic English speaking bartender wait on us. We clumsily ordered coffee's and a breakfast which somehow got lost in translation and we were served bread and croissants with jelly.

After the food and coffee settled, we realized how tired we truly were. We stumbled back to the hotel, figuring if we just sat in the lobby they might be more inclined to let us into our rooms early -- it worked!

It only took about 30 minutes of napping in the hotel lobby before the concierge went upstairs, returning with 'good news!' that two rooms had just become available. In hindsight I do feel a little bad for this but we were desparate!

We took the tiny elevator upstairs to the second floor and made our way to our tiny but lovely rooms.

I can't tell you much about what happened after that, because my next memory is waking up to a knock at the door, around 5 hours later. We awoke to Kelly's sister Amber coming to wake us up after 'checking out our room' apparently turned into a well-deserved 5 hour nap.

## The Streets

We then got ready and hit the streets in search of a nice dinner.

We wandered into a surreal marketplace. It was an intersection that reminded me of the five points in Gangs of New York. There were restaraunts and shops everywhere. Everything from fine dining to cheap Gyro's. Food from all cultures, music and tourist shops. Every once in a while, some brave driver would take their car down one of the cobblestone streets becomming consumed by the crowd of people.

We found a nice restaraunt by the Seine river and had a lovely dinner.

We grabbed a bottle of wine ( which are super cheap as they don't have to be imported from anywhere ) and wandered back to our hotel room. There were no glasses at the hotel ( no ice or coffee either ) so we used our tea glasses to drink a lovely Bordeux and put some French television on. It was a great night and left us excited for the next morning.
