Technorati serves a few purposes, I’m just not clear on what it does for publishers.

*hidden motive, I have to post this Technorati code, Q779M4W4TU7H  , in a post to claim this blog. I though I might as well use it to write a full fledged blog post.

## Why Technorati Is Awesome

I think it’s totally great to have a master list of all existing blogs. I think it’s awesome to keep statistics on the state of the blogosphere and Technorati does it well. I even think it’s great to give blogs numerical rankings and highlight blogs that are quickly on the rise.

## Where I’m Confused

What I don’t understand is what the benefit is for claiming your blog as a publisher. Will having your blog claimed get you more traffic or better your blog in any way? I don’t think it does and I don’t see a reason to claim my blogs. Yet I’m also not famous or super successful so I’ll continue to follow the trend.
