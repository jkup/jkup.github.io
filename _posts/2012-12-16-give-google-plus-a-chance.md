title: Give Google Plus A Chance
description: Google+ Is really a great looking web application. I think if it had the user base it would be way more fun to use than Facebook.

## In The Beginning

When Google+ first launched back in 2011 I was definitely on the *what a piece of crap* bandwagon. It felt clunky and awkward. Most importantly there was **no one using it**.

When I first joined Facebook it was already happening. Zuckerberg was really smart to introduce the social network to one college at a time. It turned a "lack of users" into "exclusivity" -- genius.

I signed up for a Google+ account right away, clicked around for a few minutes and then never used it again.

Every few months I'd pop back in. Typically it was because I recieved a friend request or wanted to check out a new feature. It had a great looking interface but besides the few Google employees I was following no one was posting updates.

## Google Hangouts

In early 2012 I took a job working remotely for a web development company. Since we were all located in different states, online communication tools were necessary for us to work. We used a lot of different programs for chat but nothing beats Google Hangouts for free video chat.

Unlike Skype, there's no software to install, it works on all operating systems and it just has a fun interface.

Still though, besides weekly Google Hangouts I just didn't see much value in Google+ as a social network.

## Facebook, Going Through Changes

I really liked Myspace.

I liked everyone having a full profile page, with blog posts and lists of your friends and favorite bands, etc. It made browsing people's profiles a fun activity.

When Facebook first took off it had a similar point to it. It also had tons of cool people on it and a better interface -- It was an easy sell.

Over the years Facebook has done all it can to streamline its operation. This isn't so much a criticism, as their 1 billion users speaks to the success of thier operation.

The point is, I really don't enjoy using Facebook as much as I used to. It feels more and more like Twitter to me, filled with endless micro-blog posts and it inspired me to look for something different.

## Not What I Was Looking For

Looking for a new social networking experience, I decided to check back in on Google+ and see how things were progressing. Unfortunatley, there still aren't a ton of people ( that I know ) using the website, and they definitely are no better than Facebook at being anything other than a micro-blogging website -- but man does that interface look inviting.

I took some time to officially set up my profile. It was really fun. Adding pictures, moving them around and cropping them. It's **so rare** these days when websites present users with interfaces that are genuinely fun to use.

I joined a few communities ( groups ) and began chatting. I still have many of my original complaints but at least for now I'm giving it a chance.

Come <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102333084042438038555/posts">find me on Google+</a> and let's give it a chance!
