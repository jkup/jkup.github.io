Yesterday, I finally Rooted my Evo 4g.

## The Story

So, I got an HTC Evo 4g something like 8 months ago and honestly thought I was going to try rooting it as soon as I got it home. I’ve been a huge Linux nerd for years and the thought of having root on an open source cell phone was almost too much for me to handle. And then I had three realizations:

1. It’s a $600 phone
2. I don’t know anything about phone operating systems
3. When my Linux computer breaks (as they always do) and I have to spend the afternoon puttering around with it, that’s annoying. If my cell phone broke for a day or two that would be catastrophic.

Needless to say, I put the plan on hold for a while and just made the most of the EVO’s fairly awesome stock interface.

## The Push

Then, about a month ago, my <a href="http://www.larrykuperman.com/">dad</a> went and rooted his Samsung Epic.

Now, as a software developer in my twenties, it’s not easy accepting that your father is a better hacker than you. But there you have it. He rooted his phone and was happily playing with all the happy features that come along with new found freedom.

## The Outcome

Jealousy got the best of me, and we got together yesterday and did a root plus <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">cyanogenmod</a> rom install on my EVO. See the pictures above.

I have to say after all the hype I’ve heard about cyanogenmod, I wasn’t super impressed with the out-of-the-box OS. It felt minimal and the UI wasn’t nearly as impressive as I had hoped. So far, the applications that have helped me achieve the look and performance I was looking for have been:

* AdFree
* Advanced Task Killer
* Dialer One
* Launcher Pro
* Sense Analog Clock

And the tools that made the whole thing possible:

* <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wjhWSalETs&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PL28A547E5FC04C8F3">This Youtube Video On How To Get Root With Android 2.3.3</a>
* ROM Manager
* Titanium Backup PRO

I thought about linking all those apps, but it’s probably just as easy for you to type them into your phone manually. Definitely check ‘em out!

Now I’m loving the cool new look, improved performance and complete lack of crappy Sprint endorsed bloatware. Goodbye Sprint News, NASCAR, Blockbuster app. Hello Android Freedom!
