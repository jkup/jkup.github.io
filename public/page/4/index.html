        <h2 id="Morning"><a href="#Morning" class="headerlink" title="Morning"></a>Morning</h2><p>We woke up early, excited.</p>
<p>Unlike most cities, Paris certainly sleeps. Leaving our hotel room around 7 in the morning it really felt like the city was ours. We grabbed a quick coffee ( If there is such a thing in Paris ) and took a walk along the river Seine.</p>
<p><img src="/images/paris-morning.jpg" alt="Morning along the Seine"></p>
<p>We walked for a good hour, twisting through neighborhoods and watching shopkeepers preparing to open their shops. Every so often we’d come across a road that was so beautiful we’d have to walk it. Letting the city guide us, we wandered around until eventually we found ourselves back in the neighborhood of our hotel. It was a great way to start a day.</p>
<p>The night before, Kelly and I had booked an all-english bicycle tour throughout the city. It met under the South leg of the Eiffel Tower – 3 miles from our hotel. Feeling adventurous, Kelly and I decided to walk to the Tower so we could really take in the city.</p>
<p>We packed a light bag and headed out.</p>
<p>Most of the distance was on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The road passes through much of what makes the neighborhood ( Saint-Germain ) so great. The neighborhood is centered around the church of the former Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.</p>
<p>We found the church!</p>
<p><img src="/images/saint-germain-church.jpg" alt="Church of Saint Germain"></p>
<p>We continued down the street for about an hour. We passed boutique’s, markets, restaurants and neighborhoods. Finally, we saw her in the distance:</p>
<p><img src="/images/eiffel-in-the-distance.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower in the Distance"></p>
<p>We grabbed some delicious sandwiches and headed over the a small park right near the Eiffel Tower. We had a wonderful brunch watching people line up to see the Tower or dine at one of the restaurants inside.</p>
<h2 id="Missed-Opportunities"><a href="#Missed-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Missed Opportunities"></a>Missed Opportunities</h2><p>Unfortunately, I had misread the email from the bicycle tour company. I was certain they had said to meet by the West leg of the tower. We arrived very early and wandered around for a good hour. Eventually settling on a small bench near the West leg. We waited and waited but no one arrived. We kept looping the tower hoping to see bicycles or some sign of a tour but saw nothing.</p>
<p>Eventually we grew tired of waiting. I tried to get online to see the email again but the only open wi-fi I could find was blocking my email ( go figure ). Kelly got the idea to look up the company’s headquarters so we could go complain and possibly get a refund. We found their address online and started heading in that direction. No sooner did we turn the corner of the Eiffel Tower did we see the bike tour, just heading out!</p>
<p>We caught up with them no problem and walked with them back to their location.</p>
<h2 id="The-Tour"><a href="#The-Tour" class="headerlink" title="The Tour"></a>The Tour</h2><p>The tour was led by a charismatic New Zealander named Costigan. He led about 12 of us over to this quiet Parisian neighborhood. We were all fitted for bikes and the tour began.</p>
<p>We rode past the Eiffel Tower and over towards the Champ de Mars ( Field of Mars ). It is a large greenspace between the Eiffel Tower and École Militaire ( Royal Millitary Building ).</p>
<p><img src="/images/field-of-mars.jpg" alt="The Field of Mars"></p>
<p>After leaving the field we went around the other side of École Militaire. We learned about the Louie’s ( 14th, 15th and 16th. ). Our tour guide said people in Paris refer to them as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The one who built it” - Louie the 14th</li>
<li>“The one who enjoyed it” - Louie the 15th</li>
<li>“The one who paid for it” - Louie the 16th</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being Louie the 15th who built the military complex we were standing in front of. *wink</p>
<p><img src="/images/paris-military.jpg" alt="École Militaire"></p>
<p>Then we rode for a long time up and down the streets of Paris. We stopped repeatedly, learning interesting tid-bits along the way. We learned that there is a strict, 8 story maximum on Parisian buildings. Our guide told us that a few years ago they decided to waive the rule and allow the construction of 7 skyscrapers in the cities financial district. They built the first one and the people were so disgusted with it that they broke the contract and re-instated the 8 story maximum. The lone skyscraper is now commonly referred to as “The Ugly”.</p>
<p>We came to Musee de l’Armee, where Napoleon’s tomb is kept. Our guide told us that his larger than life tomb requires you to stand bent at the waist to look down upon it. Apparently it is a common joke to say “Even in death, one has to bend over to look at Napoleon.”</p>
<p><img src="/images/kelly-napolean.jpg" alt="Napoleons tomb"></p>
<p>We biked around for another hour, finding our way to the Tuileries – the wondrous tulip gardens outside of the Louvre. We split up into small groups and had great sandwiches for lunch inside the garden.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tulip-sandwhiches.jpg" alt="Lunch"></p>
<p>We walked our bikes through the garden and concluded our tour just outside of the Louvre.</p>
<p><img src="/images/louvre.jpg" alt="Louvre"></p>
<p>Exhausted from the journey. We made our way back to our hotel, grabbing some food along the way and called it an early night.</p>

<p>It feels like a dream. A dream that isn’t mine.</p>
<h2 id="The-Arrival"><a href="#The-Arrival" class="headerlink" title="The Arrival"></a>The Arrival</h2><p>We landed at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport around 9:25am. Stepping off the plane felt like the end of any other trip. We stepped off and into the airport. It was interesting to see all the signs which stated their message first in French and then English underneath.</p>
<p>Walking through the airport there were some minor differences noticed, but realistically they could have been written off as mere eccentricities airports use to distinguish themselves. The first real oddity came when we stepped onto the escalator heading down and the stairs flattened into something of an electronic ramp taking us down to the lower level. We all almost fell – expecting the stairs to, well, stay stairs as we traveled downwards.</p>
<p>There were many of these stair-less escalators throughout the airport, one of them encased in a glass tube as it carried us up towards or baggage claim. As we were traveling upwards, we came into an enormous, open room with at least 4 other glass tubes. All presumably carrying passengers to where they needed to be. It felt like some science fiction movie watching all of these people floating through glass tubes in every direction. It was the first of many moments in which we realized we were in a new culture.</p>
<p>We found our luggage without a hitch and just as we exited the terminal, our driver was there waiting with a sign for us. I didn’t know the Charles de Gaulle Airport was a good half hour away from Paris – but smartly Kelly had arranged for a driver to pick us up and take us directly to our hotel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this driver did not speak English. It was a very quiet ride into the city.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ride"><a href="#The-Ride" class="headerlink" title="The Ride"></a>The Ride</h2><p>I have to say, the ride from the airport into the city was underwhelming. With mostly factories and outlet malls, it felt very much like a highway trip one would take in Michigan.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes in the car, we finally began to see some of the buildings that one would expect to see when traveling in Paris. They were off in the distance but they were old and breath taking. At one point we even saw the tip of the Eiffel tower looming off in the distance.</p>
<p>Eventually we pulled off the highway onto a busy Boulevard. ( As far as I can tell Boulevard means a big city street and Rue is a smaller road. ). We were driving through a beautiful, bustling city now. With endless stores and restaurants on the main floor. It was definitely a wonderful experience, but besides the abundance of French writing, it was akin to driving down a street in New York or Chicago.</p>
<p>Eventually our driver pulled over on a small road. He stopped the van and we all got out. There were many shops around and it was not clear where our hotel might be. Kelly communicated with him via gestures and hand signals and eventually he picked up her suitcase and took a turn down a tiny alley off of the main road.</p>
<p>This was the first breathtaking moment I had in Paris. I was expecting restaurant dumpsters or dark, grease-soaked streets like an alleyway you’d see in America. Instead, we saw this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/parisian-alley.jpeg" alt="Give Google+ A Chance"></p>
<p>Paris is truly full of surprises. The busy boulevards are much like you’d see in other major cities. However there are countless winding alleyways with narrow one way roads lined with fancy restaurants, great hotels, and wonderful graffiti.</p>
<h2 id="The-Hotel"><a href="#The-Hotel" class="headerlink" title="The Hotel"></a>The Hotel</h2><p>We entered our hotel at around 10am, only to find that check-in wasn’t until 2pm and they didn’t seem very interested in accommodating us. We were, begrudgingly allowed, to keep our luggage in a public corner of the lobby.</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting that this time that we left Chicago at 6pm, flew 8 hours in the plane and arrived in Paris at 9:30 am – mostly without sleep. Needless to say we were quite exhausted.</p>
<p>We stuffed our belongings into the hotel lobby and headed out to the streets. Despite our complete exhaustion, it was still a wonderful experience wandering the streets of Paris early in the morning. Unfortunately, it was Sunday and almost everything in Paris is closed on Sundays. We just walked the streets taking in the many sights. There were a lot of great parks, interesting shops, public recycling stations, bicycle rentals and so many dogs!</p>
<p>Finally we found our way to a small bar / cafe for our first Parisian dining experience. Luckily, as not one of us spoke French, we had a very charismatic English speaking bartender wait on us. We clumsily ordered coffee’s and a breakfast which somehow got lost in translation and we were served bread and croissants with jelly.</p>
<p>After the food and coffee settled, we realized how tired we truly were. We stumbled back to the hotel, figuring if we just sat in the lobby they might be more inclined to let us into our rooms early – it worked!</p>
<p>It only took about 30 minutes of napping in the hotel lobby before the concierge went upstairs, returning with ‘good news!’ that two rooms had just become available. In hindsight I do feel a little bad for this but we were desparate!</p>
<p>We took the tiny elevator upstairs to the second floor and made our way to our tiny but lovely rooms.</p>
<p><img src="/images/first-hotel-room.jpeg" alt="Give Google+ A Chance"></p>
<p>I can’t tell you much about what happened after that, because my next memory is waking up to a knock at the door, around 5 hours later. We awoke to Kelly’s sister Amber coming to wake us up after ‘checking out our room’ apparently turned into a well-deserved 5 hour nap.</p>
<h2 id="The-Streets"><a href="#The-Streets" class="headerlink" title="The Streets"></a>The Streets</h2><p>We then got ready and hit the streets in search of a nice dinner.</p>
<p>We wandered into a surreal marketplace. It was an intersection that reminded me of the five points in Gangs of New York. There were restaraunts and shops everywhere. Everything from fine dining to cheap Gyro’s. Food from all cultures, music and tourist shops. Every once in a while, some brave driver would take their car down one of the cobblestone streets becomming consumed by the crowd of people.</p>
<p>We found a nice restaraunt by the Seine river and had a lovely dinner.</p>
<p><img src="/images/paris-first-dinner.jpg" alt="Give Google+ A Chance"></p>
<p>We grabbed a bottle of wine ( which are super cheap as they don’t have to be imported from anywhere ) and wandered back to our hotel room. There were no glasses at the hotel ( no ice or coffee either ) so we used our tea glasses to drink a lovely Bordeux and put some French television on. It was a great night and left us excited for the next morning.</p>

<h2 id="In-The-Beginning"><a href="#In-The-Beginning" class="headerlink" title="In The Beginning"></a>In The Beginning</h2><p>When Google+ first launched back in 2011 I was definitely on the <em>what a piece of crap</em> bandwagon. It felt clunky and awkward. Most importantly there was <strong>no one using it</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first joined Facebook it was already happening. Zuckerberg was really smart to introduce the social network to one college at a time. It turned a “lack of users” into “exclusivity” – genius.</p>
<p>I signed up for a Google+ account right away, clicked around for a few minutes and then never used it again.</p>
<p>Every few months I’d pop back in. Typically it was because I recieved a friend request or wanted to check out a new feature. It had a great looking interface but besides the few Google employees I was following no one was posting updates.</p>
<h2 id="Google-Hangouts"><a href="#Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="Google Hangouts"></a>Google Hangouts</h2><p>In early 2012 I took a job working remotely for a web development company. Since we were all located in different states, online communication tools were necessary for us to work. We used a lot of different programs for chat but nothing beats Google Hangouts for free video chat.</p>
<p>Unlike Skype, there’s no software to install, it works on all operating systems and it just has a fun interface.</p>
<p>Still though, besides weekly Google Hangouts I just didn’t see much value in Google+ as a social network.</p>
<h2 id="Facebook-Going-Through-Changes"><a href="#Facebook-Going-Through-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Facebook, Going Through Changes"></a>Facebook, Going Through Changes</h2><p>I really liked Myspace.</p>
<p>I liked everyone having a full profile page, with blog posts and lists of your friends and favorite bands, etc. It made browsing people’s profiles a fun activity.</p>
<p>When Facebook first took off it had a similar point to it. It also had tons of cool people on it and a better interface – It was an easy sell.</p>
<p>Over the years Facebook has done all it can to streamline its operation. This isn’t so much a criticism, as their 1 billion users speaks to the success of thier operation.</p>
<p>The point is, I really don’t enjoy using Facebook as much as I used to. It feels more and more like Twitter to me, filled with endless micro-blog posts and it inspired me to look for something different.</p>
<h2 id="Not-What-I-Was-Looking-For"><a href="#Not-What-I-Was-Looking-For" class="headerlink" title="Not What I Was Looking For"></a>Not What I Was Looking For</h2><p>Looking for a new social networking experience, I decided to check back in on Google+ and see how things were progressing. Unfortunatley, there still aren’t a ton of people ( that I know ) using the website, and they definitely are no better than Facebook at being anything other than a micro-blogging website – but man does that interface look inviting.</p>
<p>I took some time to officially set up my profile. It was really fun. Adding pictures, moving them around and cropping them. It’s <strong>so rare</strong> these days when websites present users with interfaces that are genuinely fun to use.</p>
<p>I joined a few communities ( groups ) and began chatting. I still have many of my original complaints but at least for now I’m giving it a chance.</p>
<p>Come <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102333084042438038555/posts" target="_blank" rel="external">find me on Google+</a> and let’s give it a chance!</p>

        <p>As a young developer, I still distinctly remember the learning process. I remember feeling confused – very confused.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I’d have a great victory. But as the old adage goes, the more I learned the less I knew. It was always:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where do I paste that?</p>
<p>What’s a library?</p>
<p>What does a database look like?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Enter-W3School-–-My-Personal-Savior"><a href="#Enter-W3School-–-My-Personal-Savior" class="headerlink" title="Enter W3School – My Personal Savior"></a>Enter W3School – My Personal Savior</h2><p>It seemed as though no matter what I was stuck on, W3Schools had the answer.</p>
<p><img src="/images/w3schools.jpg" alt="Ode to w3schools"></p>
<p>It’s really quite incredible. The website covers introductory tutorials on almost every web language. The tutorials are brief, interactive and easy to follow.</p>
<p>I probably spent more time on w3schools.com than any other website during my first 6 months of web development.</p>
<h2 id="So-Why-All-The-Hatred"><a href="#So-Why-All-The-Hatred" class="headerlink" title="So, Why All The Hatred?"></a>So, Why All The Hatred?</h2><p>Years have gone by, and I don’t spend so much ( or any ) time on their website anymore. Somewhere along the way, I picked up on the common theme of W3Schools bashing. I think a lot of the mentality can be summed up at the pointedly named W3Fools website.</p>
<p>It’s clear there are a lot of criticisms being made against the website, so let’s just talk about the main three.</p>
<p>There are inaccuracies on the website, and they won’t fix them.<br>They appear affiliated with the W3C, which they are not.<br>They will not wikify their content.</p>
<h3 id="Some-Stuff-Is-Wrong-And-They-Won’t-Correct-It"><a href="#Some-Stuff-Is-Wrong-And-They-Won’t-Correct-It" class="headerlink" title="Some Stuff Is Wrong And They Won’t Correct It."></a>Some Stuff Is Wrong And They Won’t Correct It.</h3><p>This one is pretty straightforward. I don’t care so much that there are inaccuracies on the website, but if people really have sent in emails and fixes and been ignored that is a problem.</p>
<p>It appears to me that W3Schools is run by a single person. The fact that a small amount of the information is incorrect is really not a big deal when you think about how much content there is. Again though, if he(they) is refusing to fix the problems when they are pointed out, that is too bad.</p>
<h3 id="They-Appear-Affiliated-With-The-W3C"><a href="#They-Appear-Affiliated-With-The-W3C" class="headerlink" title="They Appear Affiliated With The W3C"></a>They Appear Affiliated With The W3C</h3><p>For those in the know the W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, it is an international organization that governs the web. W3Schools rides off the notoriety of that name despite being unaffiliated. Is that really a complaint? How many JavaScript developers are out there that think this is an issue?</p>
<h3 id="They-Will-Not-Wikify"><a href="#They-Will-Not-Wikify" class="headerlink" title="They Will Not Wikify"></a>They Will Not Wikify</h3><p> While I admire the idea of Wikify’ing websites for the good of the community, it’s a pretty large demand. W3Schools is a wildly successful website ( with a good amount of ads ). It’s a valuable resource to be sure, but that doesn’t mean it should be public property. Again, I’d love to see it happen – but that doesn’t mean it should happen.</p>
<h2 id="Still-A-Fan"><a href="#Still-A-Fan" class="headerlink" title="Still A Fan"></a>Still A Fan</h2><p> I’ve read a lot of the criticism against the site, but all-in-all I think it’s an amazing resource and we could all appreciate it a bit more.</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Last year, I finally turned a spectator’s interest for programming computers into a full time hobby and now it has become a full time job.</p>
<p>As I continue to learn more about programming, operating systems and development there are a few transitions that I find quite surprising.</p>
<h2 id="Nothing-Good-Has-Happened-To-Computers-Since-1993"><a href="#Nothing-Good-Has-Happened-To-Computers-Since-1993" class="headerlink" title="Nothing Good Has Happened To Computers Since 1993"></a>Nothing Good Has Happened To Computers Since 1993</h2><p>Are you upset yet? Good, because I’m (sort of) kidding.</p>
<p>One such strange transition is that I’ve begun using more and more pre-1995 software. When I first began designing websites it seemed that the newer and flashier the software was, the better time I’d have using it to build things.</p>
<h3 id="The-Original-Configuration"><a href="#The-Original-Configuration" class="headerlink" title="The Original Configuration"></a>The Original Configuration</h3><p>For example, my original workstation was something to the extent of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 Worth Of Hardware</li>
<li>Windows 7</li>
<li>The Full Adobe Suite ( Photoshop &amp; Dreamweaver )</li>
<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that this was a particularly bad setup, but it is slow and very costly. As I delve deeper into programming I spend a lot of time worrying about efficiency.</p>
<p>This study in efficiency has taken me to some unlikely places. I find time and time again that old UNIX apps make me so much faster than those nice, flashy OSX applications ever did.</p>
<h3 id="The-New-Configuration"><a href="#The-New-Configuration" class="headerlink" title="The New Configuration"></a>The New Configuration</h3><p>These days, my set-up looks a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same (used to be) $1,000 Worth Of Hardware</li>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Vim For Text Editing</li>
<li>Terminal Applications Like IRSSI, SSH and FTP</li>
</ul>
<p>I find these applications exceptional for getting work done quickly. The only thing I find strange is the looming feeling that we don’t have any better tools now than we did 20+ years ago.</p>
