        <p>This semester, I’ve decided to go back to school and finish getting my degree.</p>
<p>Just to make sure we’re clear, the only reason I’ve decided to finish school is because I’m already more than half way there and it just seems silly to start paying back my loans with nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>Moving on…</p>
<h2 id="Apparently-Wi-Fi-Impedes-Learning"><a href="#Apparently-Wi-Fi-Impedes-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Apparently Wi-Fi Impedes Learning"></a>Apparently Wi-Fi Impedes Learning</h2><p>Unfortunately, one of my particularly boring classes has some sort of rudimentary technology blocking the campus wireless signal from inside the classrooms.</p>
<p>An easy fix right? — Just use my rooted android phone to tether to my laptop. Unfortunately, my class is on the 7th floor and I have somewhere between 0 and 1 bar of 3G service.</p>
<p>Okay, so I set my phone to tether, and use my Netbook to hop on the tethered Wi-Fi connection. Now I’m sitting in class on an 11″ Netbook screen trying to browse the web at less than 300 bytes per second. This has given me a whole new perspective on designing websites.</p>
<p>I mean, really think about it. How fast is your website? How long would it take to load on a 300 bytes per second connection? I know 300 bytes is ridiculous but let’s think about someone on a standard 56k dial-up connection. How long would your website take to load for that person?</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-fast-is-your-website.png" alt="how fast is your website"></p>
<p>I’ve got my site down to 66.7KB, which is not achievable for anything but a minimalist design like this one. My website would take a little more than a second to load, even on a slow dial-up connection.</p>
<h2 id="I’m-Awesome-But-That’s-Not-The-Point"><a href="#I’m-Awesome-But-That’s-Not-The-Point" class="headerlink" title="I’m Awesome, But That’s Not The Point"></a>I’m Awesome, But That’s Not The Point</h2><p>The real point I’m trying to drive home here is that often times we as designers, developers, publishers or what-have-you get seduced by sweet plugins and forget what the cost is. Remember that each plugin, CSS file, Javascript file, etc is another HTTP request — and they add up quick!</p>
<p>Things you probably don’t need that are killing your websites load times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript Comment Systems – Disqus, Livefyre, etc.</li>
<li>More Than One CSS File – Seriously, just combine them.</li>
<li>More Than One JavaScript File – See Above.</li>
<li>Poorly Compressed Images</li>
<li>Not-Minified CSS and JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/macbook.jpg" alt="not another apple fan boy"></p>
<p>I tried and tried, but today I return my Macbook Pro.</p>
<h2 id="The-Story"><a href="#The-Story" class="headerlink" title="The Story"></a>The Story</h2><p>About two weeks ago, I had a big client meeting that required a slideshow presentation. I made a great slideshow on my desktop and marked the meeting in my calendar. The day of the meeting I started getting ready and going over my material when it dawned on me, I don’t have a laptop!</p>
<p>Long story short — I ended up driving to Best Buy last minute and shopping for laptops.  There are few stores I hate shopping at as much as Best Buy, but that’s where I ended up. I really wanted a laptop that stood out more than the average computer. Something to impress potential clients with and make me feel good about using. It turned out, the laptops I wanted fell somewhere in the $700 range.</p>
<p>Now, I really hadn’t considered buying a Macbook at this point, but $700 seemed so close to the $1,300 for a brand new Macbook Pro. When I found out Macbook’s come pre-packaged with iMovie and Garageband I was sold. So I went ahead and bought it.</p>
<h2 id="First-Impressions"><a href="#First-Impressions" class="headerlink" title="First Impressions"></a>First Impressions</h2><p>Getting my Macbook out of the box was breathtaking. I mean, they really know how to sell you. After taking it out of the box, I really fell for the install process and the user interface. Installing software is really fun and using it is even better. I couldn’t believe the interfaces that most Apple apps came with. I thought I was going to be an Apple user forever.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>The main problem I’ve had with the Macbook Pro is performance. I know I bought the cheapest model but seriously there shouldn’t be much a $1,300 notebook can’t do. I tried video editing on it and it lags terribly. Even downloading applications lags out and takes longer than it should. If I spent that much money on a PC it would be lighting fast. I think one day I’ll probably save up and buy a Mac running a quad-core processor. However, for now I’m going to return it and spend my money on something else.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/twitter.jpg" alt="who uses twitter"></p>
<p>So, I’ve been using Twitter for a while now at <a href="http://twitter.com/jkup" target="_blank" rel="external">@jkup</a> for my work and I think I’m finally getting the hang of it. It’s obvious to me that it is a great marketing and education tool but I can’t help but wonder how to use it as a form of social media.</p>
<h2 id="How-I-Use-Twitter"><a href="#How-I-Use-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How I Use Twitter"></a>How I Use Twitter</h2><p>I’ve been on Twitter for about 6 months now and I’ve gone through a few different strategies for getting the most out of it.</p>
<p>At first I tried using Twitter as though it were some streaming RSS Feed. I only subscribed to my favorite blogs and kept an eye out for updates.</p>
<p>This worked quite well at first. I’d check in and see what new posts were circulating the internet in my field, reading them as I went. But after a while it started to feel lonely.</p>
<p>Then I tried making friends on Twitter. I followed some advice I had seen on a few blogs and waiting for people I followed to ask questions, jumping in to answer them. I did this about 10 times and two things happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one ever wrote me back</li>
<li>None of them ever followed me</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I understand that most of the people I follow are famous and have thousands of followers themselves but it was certainly discouraging to not get a single response.</p>
<h2 id="The-Real-Problem"><a href="#The-Real-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Real Problem"></a>The Real Problem</h2><p>Thinking back on the issue, I’m fairly sure the real problem is that I don’t have any of my real friends on Twitter. It seems to me that Twitter is a great tool and your followers easily grow from somewhat of a snowball effect. My issue, being that I don’ t have the initial amount of snow necessary to start the snowball.</p>
<p>You’re The Solution!</p>
<p>Wanna help my problem and get your Twitter account going as well? <a href="http://twitter.com/jkup" target="_blank" rel="external">Add me on Twitter and let’s start talking!</a></p>
<p>I’m really looking to meet some people that are interested in web development and maybe collaborate on some awesome projects!</p>

<p>Yesterday, I finally Rooted my Evo 4g.</p>
<h2 id="The-Story"><a href="#The-Story" class="headerlink" title="The Story"></a>The Story</h2><p>So, I got an HTC Evo 4g something like 8 months ago and honestly thought I was going to try rooting it as soon as I got it home. I’ve been a huge Linux nerd for years and the thought of having root on an open source cell phone was almost too much for me to handle. And then I had three realizations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s a $600 phone</li>
<li>I don’t know anything about phone operating systems</li>
<li>When my Linux computer breaks (as they always do) and I have to spend the afternoon puttering around with it, that’s annoying. If my cell phone broke for a day or two that would be catastrophic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, I put the plan on hold for a while and just made the most of the EVO’s fairly awesome stock interface.</p>
<h2 id="The-Push"><a href="#The-Push" class="headerlink" title="The Push"></a>The Push</h2><p>Then, about a month ago, my <a href="http://www.larrykuperman.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">dad</a> went and rooted his Samsung Epic.</p>
<p>Now, as a software developer in my twenties, it’s not easy accepting that your father is a better hacker than you. But there you have it. He rooted his phone and was happily playing with all the happy features that come along with new found freedom.</p>
<h2 id="The-Outcome"><a href="#The-Outcome" class="headerlink" title="The Outcome"></a>The Outcome</h2><p>Jealousy got the best of me, and we got together yesterday and did a root plus <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">cyanogenmod</a> rom install on my EVO. See the pictures above.</p>
<p>I have to say after all the hype I’ve heard about cyanogenmod, I wasn’t super impressed with the out-of-the-box OS. It felt minimal and the UI wasn’t nearly as impressive as I had hoped. So far, the applications that have helped me achieve the look and performance I was looking for have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>AdFree</li>
<li>Advanced Task Killer</li>
<li>Dialer One</li>
<li>Launcher Pro</li>
<li>Sense Analog Clock</li>
</ul>
<p>And the tools that made the whole thing possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wjhWSalETs&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PL28A547E5FC04C8F3" target="_blank" rel="external">This Youtube Video On How To Get Root With Android 2.3.3</a></li>
<li>ROM Manager</li>
<li>Titanium Backup PRO</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought about linking all those apps, but it’s probably just as easy for you to type them into your phone manually. Definitely check ‘em out!</p>
<p>Now I’m loving the cool new look, improved performance and complete lack of crappy Sprint endorsed bloatware. Goodbye Sprint News, NASCAR, Blockbuster app. Hello Android Freedom!</p>

<h2 id="I-Am-Not-A-Graphic-Designer"><a href="#I-Am-Not-A-Graphic-Designer" class="headerlink" title="I Am Not A Graphic Designer"></a>I Am Not A Graphic Designer</h2><p>Before I start this rant, I think it’s only fair to tell you all that I am in no way a graphic designer. I love design, both print and web but I’ve never been good at creation.  This attack is not actually at Adobe Photoshop, which is obviously a great piece of software, but it is the now standard practice of web designers using Photoshop to create mock-ups and drafts before building their website.</p>
<p>My problem is simply that Photoshop is not the medium in which websites exist. Websites exist in web browsers and should be designed accordingly. Photoshop is often times an unnecessary step between your vision and an amazing website.</p>
<h2 id="I-Am-A-Web-Designer"><a href="#I-Am-A-Web-Designer" class="headerlink" title="I Am A Web Designer"></a>I Am A Web Designer</h2><p>While I’m not a big print designer, I do make websites for a living. I’m not just blowing steam here and I really do think you can efficiently run a web design business without making Photoshop mock-ups.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you should just jump in to a WordPress install and hope for the best. I believe in sketching, wire frames and information architecture. However, I think that all of these things can be done easily and more efficiently with pen and paper.  After sketching everything out, why waste your time making a function-less picture? Just go ahead and code your design. If your client wants something changed, go for it! Just don’t make your job harder than it has to be.</p>
<h2 id="37-Signals-Agrees-With-Me"><a href="#37-Signals-Agrees-With-Me" class="headerlink" title="37 Signals Agrees With Me"></a>37 Signals Agrees With Me</h2><p>This really isn’t meant as social proof or anything. I was just fully prepared to take this stance alone when I found this article:</p>
