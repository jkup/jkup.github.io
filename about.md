<img class="bio-pic" src="/images/jon.jpg" alt="Jon Kuperman" />
I'm a web programmer in my mid-twenties. I run a Michigan Web Design Company I'm an avid Linux enthusiast, PHP developer and I love building web applications.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for Barracuda Networks on their Backup product.

I run the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/">PHP User Group</a> in Ann Arbor. I love <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/160963">Speaking at Conferences</a> across the country.

In my free time I love playing soccer, hanging out with my dogs and my awesome <a href="http://www.kellyking.me">girlfriend Kelly King</a>!
