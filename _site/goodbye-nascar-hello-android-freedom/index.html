<p>Yesterday, I finally Rooted my Evo 4g.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>So, I got an HTC Evo 4g something like 8 months ago and honestly thought I was going to try rooting it as soon as I got it home. I’ve been a huge Linux nerd for years and the thought of having root on an open source cell phone was almost too much for me to handle. And then I had three realizations:</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s a $600 phone</li>
<li>I don’t know anything about phone operating systems</li>
<li>When my Linux computer breaks (as they always do) and I have to spend the afternoon puttering around with it, that’s annoying. If my cell phone broke for a day or two that would be catastrophic.</li>
</ol>


<p>Needless to say, I put the plan on hold for a while and just made the most of the EVO’s fairly awesome stock interface.</p>

<h2>The Push</h2>

<p>Then, about a month ago, my <a href="http://www.larrykuperman.com/">dad</a> went and rooted his Samsung Epic.</p>

<p>Now, as a software developer in my twenties, it’s not easy accepting that your father is a better hacker than you. But there you have it. He rooted his phone and was happily playing with all the happy features that come along with new found freedom.</p>

<h2>The Outcome</h2>

<p>Jealousy got the best of me, and we got together yesterday and did a root plus <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">cyanogenmod</a> rom install on my EVO. See the pictures above.</p>

<p>I have to say after all the hype I’ve heard about cyanogenmod, I wasn’t super impressed with the out-of-the-box OS. It felt minimal and the UI wasn’t nearly as impressive as I had hoped. So far, the applications that have helped me achieve the look and performance I was looking for have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>AdFree</li>
<li>Advanced Task Killer</li>
<li>Dialer One</li>
<li>Launcher Pro</li>
<li>Sense Analog Clock</li>
</ul>


<p>And the tools that made the whole thing possible:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wjhWSalETs&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PL28A547E5FC04C8F3">This Youtube Video On How To Get Root With Android 2.3.3</a></li>
<li>ROM Manager</li>
<li>Titanium Backup PRO</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought about linking all those apps, but it’s probably just as easy for you to type them into your phone manually. Definitely check ‘em out!</p>

<p>Now I’m loving the cool new look, improved performance and complete lack of crappy Sprint endorsed bloatware. Goodbye Sprint News, NASCAR, Blockbuster app. Hello Android Freedom!</p>
