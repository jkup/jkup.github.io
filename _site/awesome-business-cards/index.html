    <h1>Awesome Business Cards</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/moo.jpg" alt="awesome business cards" /></p>

<p>Oh man, did I just get some awesome business cards in the mail today. If you're looking for the abridged version of this post, I strongly recommend you head over to <a href="http://www.moo.com">MOO</a> and order up some seriously high quality business cards. You should browse their awesome design gallery, fill out their actually easy to use Flash application and make sure you order the rounded corners!</p>

<h2>My Life Before MOO</h2>

<p>In early 2011, I started my own web design company. ( Then called <strong>Hand Coded Creations</strong> ). I built myself a website, turned my spare bedroom into an office and away I went. At some point I decided that I needed business cards to hand out, not just because they are vital to any travelling salesperson but because <em>Hand Coded Creations</em> is really hard to remember. As I've claimed before, <a href="http://www.jonkuperman.com/photoshop-is-in-my-way/">I Am Not A Graphic Designer</a>, so I just went to VistaPrint and ordered up 500 crazy stock cards with an exploding computer or some such on the front and my business information on the back ( hey, I was 23 ).</p>

<p>The cards came:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jonkuperman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/vistaprint.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112" title="vistaprint" src="/images/vistaprint.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="383" /></a></p>

<p>I'm So Glad I Found This Picture.</p>

<p>So, the cards came and honestly, I didn't feel comfortable handing them out to most people I met with. I found myself often speaking with Non-Profit organizers and Government employees. Somehow it just didn't feel right to hand out something so loud and artsy. That wasn't nearly as big of a problem as the fact that no one could remember my business name.</p>

<p><em>"Was it hand created solutions?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Hand made creations, right?"</em></p>

<p>I shouldn't blame anyone but myself, too many words with too many syllables makes for a bad business name. So I changed it.</p>

<h2>Insite Design Lab Is Born</h2>

<p>Hand Coded Creations became <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com">Insite Design Lab</a>, and my business cards became absolutely useless. So, it's been about 8 months now that I've gotten by without having any business cards to had out to potential clients and I just can't do it anymore.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I still haven't become a graphic designer so I can't really make my own design but I really didn't want to get stuck with something embarrassing again. Enter MOO Business Cards.</p>

<p>I stumbled on MOO via this <a href="http://smartlifeblog.com/12-places-to-get-business-cards-online/">top 12 business card companies blog post</a> and fell in love. They are definitely more expensive then Vista Print but they are so worth it. They have a large collection of high quality designs to choose from, or you can upload your own. Each design is actually a series with 1 - 10 alterations on the design. You can eliminate designs you don't like and end up with a great collection of similarly themed business cards.</p>

<p>Seriously, go check 'em out!</p>
