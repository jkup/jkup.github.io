    <h1>Becoming A Better Programmer – Feels Like Moving Backward</h1>
    <p>Last year, I finally turned a spectator’s interest for programming computers into a full time hobby and now it has become a full time job.</p>

<p>As I continue to learn more about programming, operating systems and development there are a few transitions that I find quite surprising.</p>

<h2>Nothing Good Has Happened To Computers Since 1993</h2>

<p>Are you upset yet? Good, because I’m (sort of) kidding.</p>

<p>One such strange transition is that I’ve begun using more and more pre-1995 software. When I first began designing websites it seemed that the newer and flashier the software was, the better time I’d have using it to build things.</p>

<h3>The Original Configuration</h3>

<p>For example, my original workstation was something to the extent of:</p>

<ul>
<li>$1,000 Worth Of Hardware</li>
<li>Windows 7</li>
<li>The Full Adobe Suite ( Photoshop &amp; Dreamweaver )</li>
<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>


<p>Not that this was a particularly bad setup, but it is slow and very costly. As I delve deeper into programming I spend a lot of time worrying about efficiency.</p>

<p>This study in efficiency has taken me to some unlikely places. I find time and time again that old UNIX apps make me so much faster than those nice, flashy OSX applications ever did.</p>

<h3>The New Configuration</h3>

<p>These days, my set-up looks a little something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The same (used to be) $1,000 Worth Of Hardware</li>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Vim For Text Editing</li>
<li>Terminal Applications Like IRSSI, SSH and FTP</li>
</ul>


<p>I find these applications exceptional for getting work done quickly. The only thing I find strange is the looming feeling that we don’t have any better tools now than we did 20+ years ago.</p>

          I'm a web programmer in my mid-twenties. I run a <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/">Michigan Web Design Company</a> I'm an avid Linux enthusiast, PHP developer and I love building web applications.
