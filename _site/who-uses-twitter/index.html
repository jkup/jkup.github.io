    <h1>Who Uses Twitter</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/twitter.jpg" alt="who uses twitter" /></p>

<p>So, I’ve been using Twitter for a while now at <a href="http://twitter.com/insitedesignlab">@insitedesignlab</a> for my work and I think I’m finally getting the hang of it. It’s obvious to me that it is a great marketing and education tool but I can’t help but wonder how to use it as a form of social media.</p>

<h2>How I Use Twitter</h2>

<p>I’ve been on Twitter for about 6 months now and I’ve gone through a few different strategies for getting the most out of it.</p>

<p>At first I tried using Twitter as though it were some streaming RSS Feed. I only subscribed to my favorite blogs and kept an eye out for updates.</p>

<p>This worked quite well at first. I’d check in and see what new posts were circulating the internet in my field, reading them as I went. But after a while it started to feel lonely.</p>

<p>Then I tried making friends on Twitter. I followed some advice I had seen on a few blogs and waiting for people I followed to ask questions, jumping in to answer them. I did this about 10 times and two things happened:</p>

<ol>
<li>No one ever wrote me back</li>
<li>None of them ever followed me</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, I understand that most of the people I follow are famous and have thousands of followers themselves but it was certainly discouraging to not get a single response.</p>

<h2>The Real Problem</h2>

<p>Thinking back on the issue, I’m fairly sure the real problem is that I don’t have any of my real friends on Twitter. It seems to me that Twitter is a great tool and your followers easily grow from somewhat of a snowball effect. My issue, being that I don’ t have the initial amount of snow necessary to start the snowball.</p>

<p>You’re The Solution!</p>

<p>Wanna help my problem and get your Twitter account going as well? <a href="http://twitter.com/insitedesignlab">Add me on Twitter and let’s start talking!</a></p>

<p>I’m really looking to meet some people that are interested in web development and maybe collaborate on some awesome projects!</p>
