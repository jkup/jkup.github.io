    <h1>Not Another Apple Fan Boy</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/macbook.jpg" alt="not another apple fan boy" /></p>

<p>I tried and tried, but today I return my Macbook Pro.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>About two weeks ago, I had a big client meeting that required a slideshow presentation. I made a great slideshow on my desktop and marked the meeting in my calendar. The day of the meeting I started getting ready and going over my material when it dawned on me, I don’t have a laptop!</p>

<p>Long story short — I ended up driving to Best Buy last minute and shopping for laptops.  There are few stores I hate shopping at as much as Best Buy, but that’s where I ended up. I really wanted a laptop that stood out more than the average computer. Something to impress potential clients with and make me feel good about using. It turned out, the laptops I wanted fell somewhere in the $700 range.</p>

<p>Now, I really hadn’t considered buying a Macbook at this point, but $700 seemed so close to the $1,300 for a brand new Macbook Pro. When I found out Macbook’s come pre-packaged with iMovie and Garageband I was sold. So I went ahead and bought it.</p>

<h2>First Impressions</h2>

<p>Getting my Macbook out of the box was breathtaking. I mean, they really know how to sell you. After taking it out of the box, I really fell for the install process and the user interface. Installing software is really fun and using it is even better. I couldn’t believe the interfaces that most Apple apps came with. I thought I was going to be an Apple user forever.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The main problem I’ve had with the Macbook Pro is performance. I know I bought the cheapest model but seriously there shouldn’t be much a $1,300 notebook can’t do. I tried video editing on it and it lags terribly. Even downloading applications lags out and takes longer than it should. If I spent that much money on a PC it would be lighting fast. I think one day I’ll probably save up and buy a Mac running a quad-core processor. However, for now I’m going to return it and spend my money on something else.</p>
