<h2>In The Beginning</h2>

<p>When Google+ first launched back in 2011 I was definitely on the <em>what a piece of crap</em> bandwagon. It felt clunky and awkward. Most importantly there was <strong>no one using it</strong>.</p>

<p>When I first joined Facebook it was already happening. Zuckerberg was really smart to introduce the social network to one college at a time. It turned a "lack of users" into "exclusivity" -- genius.</p>

<p>I signed up for a Google+ account right away, clicked around for a few minutes and then never used it again.</p>

<p>Every few months I'd pop back in. Typically it was because I recieved a friend request or wanted to check out a new feature. It had a great looking interface but besides the few Google employees I was following no one was posting updates.</p>

<h2>Google Hangouts</h2>

<p>In early 2012 I took a job working remotely for a web development company. Since we were all located in different states, online communication tools were necessary for us to work. We used a lot of different programs for chat but nothing beats Google Hangouts for free video chat.</p>

<p>Unlike Skype, there's no software to install, it works on all operating systems and it just has a fun interface.</p>

<p>Still though, besides weekly Google Hangouts I just didn't see much value in Google+ as a social network.</p>

<h2>Facebook, Going Through Changes</h2>

<p>I really liked Myspace.</p>

<p>I liked everyone having a full profile page, with blog posts and lists of your friends and favorite bands, etc. It made browsing people's profiles a fun activity.</p>

<p>When Facebook first took off it had a similar point to it. It also had tons of cool people on it and a better interface -- It was an easy sell.</p>

<p>Over the years Facebook has done all it can to streamline its operation. This isn't so much a criticism, as their 1 billion users speaks to the success of thier operation.</p>

<p>The point is, I really don't enjoy using Facebook as much as I used to. It feels more and more like Twitter to me, filled with endless micro-blog posts and it inspired me to look for something different.</p>

<h2>Not What I Was Looking For</h2>

<p>Looking for a new social networking experience, I decided to check back in on Google+ and see how things were progressing. Unfortunatley, there still aren't a ton of people ( that I know ) using the website, and they definitely are no better than Facebook at being anything other than a micro-blogging website -- but man does that interface look inviting.</p>

<p>I took some time to officially set up my profile. It was really fun. Adding pictures, moving them around and cropping them. It's <strong>so rare</strong> these days when websites present users with interfaces that are genuinely fun to use.</p>

<p>I joined a few communities ( groups ) and began chatting. I still have many of my original complaints but at least for now I'm giving it a chance.</p>

<p>Come <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102333084042438038555/posts">find me on Google+</a> and let's give it a chance!</p>
