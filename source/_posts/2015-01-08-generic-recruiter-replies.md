If you're in the tech industry, you are probably fortunate enough to be constantly bombarded with recruiter emails.

There are a few things at play here:

1. There is a shortage of talent in software engineering.
2. Most companies can't compete with what the top 5% of companies can offer.
3. Most recruiter emails go unanswered.

> It's sort of ridiculous, living in an age where your skill is in such demand that you find job offers or company interest a daily annoyance but, here we are.

The thing is, nobody has time on either side of this equation. Recruiters need to send dozens if not hundreds of emails per week. It just doesn't make sense for them to spend time personalizing each one.

On the other hand, engineers are getting sometimes dozens ( I hope not hundreds ) of these emails every week as well. It in no way makes sense for them to respond to each individually.

Rather than ignoring these emails, I think it works out nicely for both parties if you ( the engineer ) has an equally polite ( and equally generic ) response email. This way you can make their day a little better and build a nice group of people that could help you find your next job ( when you are looking ).

Mine goes a little something like this:

> Hey recruiter,
>
> Thanks for reaching out! I'm not looking to change things up right now but if you'd like to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonkuperman) I'd be happy to let you know whenever I'm looking for something new.

> Thanks again,
> Jon Kuperman

Here are my thoughts on why this is a good thing to do:

1. It's good manners.
2. There is no harm in having another open door.
3. I still find it flattering that people reach out and email me! There was a time in my life where I would have loved a recruiter email and it wasn't too long ago.
4. I feel a bit bad at how rarely recruiters get replies.

## What's your approach?

Do you respond to recruiters? Do you have a generic reply like me? Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jkup)!
