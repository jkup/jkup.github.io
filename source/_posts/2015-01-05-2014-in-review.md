I haven't written a *year in review* on my personal blog before, but it feels appropriate. I was writing them on my old company's website ( good luck finding it! ) but since it is no more, this feels like the right place.

## The Big Move

Easily the biggest change in my life this year is that [@kng](http://twitter.com/kng) and I moved to San Francisco! It's been a really incredible time. We both took jobs doing web development at [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and have been having a blast!

## New Friends

A.K.A Living 3000 miles away from everyone you know

I feel lucky in so many ways this year. I got a great job working for Twitter and they helped me move across the country. I landed on a great team and they did an awesome job welcoming me to the city.

To be totally honest, it's been pretty difficult being three thousand miles and a three hour time change away from all of my friends and family. I had to get used to not calling people too late in the PST evening!

It's been a big help having so great people on my team and also awesome that some of my friends like [@kng](http://twitter.com/kng), [@tlhunter](http://twitter.com/tlhunter), [@rcorral](http://twitter.com/rcorral) and [@Rabbi_42](http://twitter.com/Rabbi_42) came out to San Francisco too! We all live next door to each other in an apartment complex.

## JavaScript

Working at Twitter has given me the opportunity to work with a lot of smart and passionate people. It's caused me to spend a good amount of time thinking about where I really want to end up in my career.

Until now, I've mostly just gone with the flow as far as programming languages and frameworks. I've always had technologies that struck my fancy, which I'd toy with during my freetime, but I hadn't given much thought to what technologies I really want to master.

As of right now, JavaScript really takes the cake as the most interesting / appealing language right now. I've been loving building Node.js apps in my freetime ( check my [Github](https://github.com/jkup) for them in the coming months! ) and doing a lot of front end JS work as well.

## New Year Resolutions

Here are some things I hope to accomplish this year. I'll publish them here so you all can encourage / chastise me if I don't complete them!

+ Speak at 5 conferences
+ Write 50 blog posts
+ Lose weight / exercise more
+ Create / Contribute to an important piece of OSS

I hope you all had a great year as well! Here's to an even better 2015!
