Ever seen a screenshot of someone rocking Chrome with a custom theme for their developer tools?

It's not quite as easy as I hoped it would be, but this short tutorial will show you how to get up and running.

## Step 1 - Download a Theme

Check out <a href="http://devthemez.com/themes/chrome-developer-tools">DevThemez</a> and find a theme that looks great for you. Clicking on a theme's download button will take you to the Chrome Webstore. Click the install link and you'll have the theme downloaded and installed.

## Step 2 - Turn on Experiment

In your URL bar, type:
<pre>chrome://flags/</pre>
Scroll down to the experiment titled 'Enable Developer Tools experiemnt' and enable it.

## Step 3 - Reload Chrome

## Step 4 - Allow Custom Themes

Open Developer Tools and click the settings cog in the top right corner.

Select 'Experiments' from the left sidebar. Scroll to the bottom and select 'Allow custom UI themes'.

## Step 5 - Restart Devtools

( close and open them again )

You should be good to go!

Enjoy!
