title: Becoming A Better Programmer – Feels Like Moving Backward
description: Why are all of my favorite programming tools pre 1993?

Last year, I finally turned a spectator’s interest for programming computers into a full time hobby and now it has become a full time job.

As I continue to learn more about programming, operating systems and development there are a few transitions that I find quite surprising.

## Nothing Good Has Happened To Computers Since 1993

Are you upset yet? Good, because I’m (sort of) kidding.

One such strange transition is that I’ve begun using more and more pre-1995 software. When I first began designing websites it seemed that the newer and flashier the software was, the better time I’d have using it to build things.

### The Original Configuration

For example, my original workstation was something to the extent of:

* $1,000 Worth Of Hardware
* Windows 7
* The Full Adobe Suite ( Photoshop & Dreamweaver )
* And so on…

Not that this was a particularly bad setup, but it is slow and very costly. As I delve deeper into programming I spend a lot of time worrying about efficiency.

This study in efficiency has taken me to some unlikely places. I find time and time again that old UNIX apps make me so much faster than those nice, flashy OSX applications ever did.

### The New Configuration

These days, my set-up looks a little something like this:

* The same (used to be) $1,000 Worth Of Hardware
* Ubuntu Linux
* Vim For Text Editing
* Terminal Applications Like IRSSI, SSH and FTP

I find these applications exceptional for getting work done quickly. The only thing I find strange is the looming feeling that we don’t have any better tools now than we did 20+ years ago.
