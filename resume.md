In January, 2012 I was brought on as a paid intern for a Chicago based web design company called Wojo Design.

Starting off my career, I was offered an internship at a web design boutique in downtown Ann Arbor. Under the tutelage of CEO Ross Johnson, I learned the foundations of CSS, HTML, Search Engine Optimization and business. We worked on a variety of projects, mostly front-end and after finishing the internship, Ross helped jump-start my career by sending many clients my way.
