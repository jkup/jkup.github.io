In January, 2012 I was brought on as a paid intern for a Chicago based web design company called Wojo Design. I got to work side by side with their designers and developers learning how they built custom applications. We worked primarily with JavaScript and Ruby on Rails although frequently we worked in the mobile space as well.

Starting off my career, I was offered an internship at a web design boutique in downtown Ann Arbor. Under the tutelage of CEO Ross Johnson, I learned the foundations of CSS, HTML, Search Engine Optimization and business. We worked on a variety of projects, mostly front-end and after finishing the internship, Ross helped jump-start my career by sending many clients my way.
